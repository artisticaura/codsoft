# 🧠 AI & Python Mini Projects

This repository contains multiple Python-based mini projects demonstrating Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and logical programming concepts. Each project focuses on a different area of AI — from image processing to simple games.

## 🧩 Project Descriptions

### 🤖 Chatbot (`chatbot.py`)

A simple chatbot that responds to user input using basic NLP or rule-based logic.
**Libraries:** `nltk`, `re`, `random`

---

### 🧍‍♀️ Face Recognition (`face_recong.py`)

Recognizes faces from an image or live webcam feed.
**Libraries:** `face_recognition`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`
**Features:**

* Detects faces from images
* Encodes known faces
* Compares and recognizes them in real time

---

### 🖼️ Image Captioning (`imagecap.py`)

Generates meaningful captions for images using deep learning.
**Libraries:** `tensorflow`, `keras`, `numpy`, `PIL`
**Concepts Used:** CNN (for feature extraction) + LSTM (for caption generation)

---

### 🎯 Recommendation System (`recommdsystem.py`)

Recommends items (movies, books, etc.) based on user preferences or similarity.
**Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`
**Concepts Used:** Content-based filtering or collaborative filtering

---

### 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (`tictactoe.py`)

A Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.
**Features:**

* Two-player or player vs AI mode
* Simple command-line interface
* Uses minimax algorithm (optional for AI)

---

## 🧾 Requirements Example

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

```
opencv-python
face_recognition
tensorflow
numpy
pandas
Pillow
scikit-learn
nltk
```

---

## 🚀 Run the Projects

Run any script directly:

```bash
python face_recong.py
python imagecap.py
python recommdsystem.py
python tictactoe.py
python chatbot.py
```

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Add graphical UI for chatbot and games
* Improve image caption model accuracy
* Integrate voice input/output for chatbot
* Use larger datasets for better recommendations
